                        <p> Hi! My name is Haruki. I am from Tokyo, Japan and I recently graduated from Carleton college with a
                            Computer Science degree. My strengths are my ability to learn, aquired through the liberal arts 
                            education in college, and my hard working nature. I love problem-solving which may relate to my love
                            in the game of chess and programming. I've also developed skills to be a great leader/team player 
                            through my premed work which I found to be a strength in other classes. Currently I am working on 
                            developing my skills as a web developer and java programming.
                        </p>

                                I solve problems on Leetcode to work on my programming skills and also just
                                to have fun. I participate in coding tournaments when I have the time to do so.
                                Currently, I code mainly in Java. See the probelms that I solved and my solutions

                            I explored a wide range of subjects outside of Computer Science at Carleton.
                            Math was a subject I explored and I completed calculus and linear algebra courses.
                            In the latter half of my college years, I explored a career in medicine. I took
                            high level courses in the sciences, such as organic chemistry, biochemistry, and human physiology. 
                            In addition, I aquired, important communication skills through my pre-med experience which proved to
                            be important in settings such as CS group projects.
