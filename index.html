                        <p> 
                            Hello my name is Haruki. Welcome to my personal website. After graduating college as a CS and 
                            premed student, I made the decision to pursue a career in tech. I am currently enrolled in the 
                            MPCS program at the University of Chicago to pursue further knowledge and level up as a software engineer.
                        </p>

                                The main goal of this project was to write some code in Javascript while reviewing some sorting algorithms.
                                Clicking on the buttons will show the sorting algorithm in work.

                            <p>
                                This was my final project for the Parallel Programming Class. We implemented a code that would simulate the nbody 
                                problem using Golang. The nbody simulation is done implementing the Barns-Hut Algorithm and the program execution 
                                can be parallelized for quicker execution. The results of the simulation can be plotted using python.

                                The program is written in Python and uses the graphics library tkinter to create an interactive GUI.

                           At Carleton, I was able to take advantage of the liberal arts education and study a 
                           wide variety of subjects outside of my major including Math, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. 
                           I completed the course work for the premed track. I did not pursue medicine as a career but 
                           I was able to develop skills to become a good team player and expand my horizon of knowledge.
                           I also was able to participate in a research project for healthcare which was a valuable expereince.
