                        <p> 
                            Hi! My name is Haruki. I recently graduated from Carleton college with a Computer Science major. 
                            My interests include software development, machine learning and AI, and theory. I like to spend my 
                            free time playing games (video and board), cooking, exercising/playing sports, watching sports, 
                            working on my programming skills, learning new skills, and chess. My strengths are my problem-solving skills,
                            ability to work as a team, my passion to learn new things, and my competitive nature. I like to put
                            myself in more challenging environments where I have people around me that will prompt me to
                            become a better version of myself and people that I can absorb and learn from.
                        </p>

                            <p>
                                I solve problems on Leetcode to work on my programming skills and also just
                                to have fun. I participate in coding tournaments when I have the time to do so.
                                Currently, I code mainly in Java. See the probelms that I solved and my solutions

                           At Carleton, I was able to take advantage of the liberal arts education and study a 
                           wide variety of subjects outside of my major including Math, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. 
                           I completed the course work for the premed track. I did not pursue medicine as a career but 
                           I was able to develop skills to become a good team player and expand my horizon of knowledge.
                           I also was able to participate in a research project for healthcare which was a valuable expereince.
