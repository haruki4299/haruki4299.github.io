                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> Hi! My name is Haruki. I am from Tokyo, Japan and I recently graduated from Carleton college with a
                    Computer Science degree. My strengths are my ability to learn, aquired through the liberal arts 
                    education in college, and my hard working nature. I love problem-solving which may relate to my love
                    in the game of chess and programming. I've also developed skills to be a great leader/team player 
                    through my premed work which I found to be a strength in other classes. Currently I am working on 
                    developing my skills as a web developer and java programming.
                </p>

                    <h3>Carleton College - Northfield, MN</h3>
                    <p>Bachelor of Arts, <i>Magna Cum Laude</i> 2018-2022</p>
                    <p><i>Phi Betta Kappa</i></p>
                    <p>Major in Computer Science</p>
                    <p>
                        I explored a wide range of subjects outside of Computer Science at Carleton.
                        Math was a subject I explored and I completed calculus and linear algebra courses.
                        In the latter half of my college years, I explored a career in medicine. I took
                        high level courses in the sciences, such as organic chemistry, biochemistry, and human physiology. 
                        In addition, I aquired, important communication skills through my pre-med experience which proved to
                        be important in settings such as CS group projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also have student work experience as a tutor in both Japanese and Computer Science. As a Japanese 
                        tutor, I helped out students of all levels with their homework assignments or understanding grammer or 
                        the culture. As a computer science tutor, I held lab sessions where I would help students mainly with 
                        their python or java assignments and I also graded assignments from classes and provided appropriate 
                        feedback to each student.
