                        <p> 
                            Hi! My name is Haruki. I recently graduated from Carleton college with a Computer Science major. 
                            My interests include software development, machine learning and AI, and Computational Biology. 
                            I like to put myself in more challenging environments where I have people around me that will prompt me to
                            become a better version of myself and people that I can absorb and learn from.
                        </p>

                                I solve problems on Leetcode to work on my programming skills and also just
                                to have fun. I participate in coding tournaments when I have the time to do so.
                                Currently, I code mainly in Python and Java. See the probelms that I solved and my solutions
                                in my GitHub Repository.

                            <p>
                                Text base poker simulator coded in python3. This is a project I started mainly for fun and practice writing larger 
                                programs. The game allows you to play against 1-5 other CPU players in poker. The basic game works
                                but the game is still in development. Some future ideas for development include a GUI (in progress),
                                and more complex CPU players.

                           I completed the course work for the premed track. I did not pursue medicine as a career but 
                           I was able to develop skills to become a good team player and expand my horizon of knowledge.
