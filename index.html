            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Hi! My name is Haruki. I am from Tokyo, Japan and I recently graduated from Carleton college with a
                Computer Science degree. During the latter half of college, I explored medicine as a career path. 
                After my gap year I figured out what I want for my career and here I am playing some catch up.
                My strengths are my ability to learn, aquired throughout my education up to college, my hard working
                nature, which may be related to my perfectionist personality, and I love problem-solving. 
                I've also developed skills to be a great leader/team player through my premed work which turned out to 
                be surprisingly useful when I was back in my CS classes. I am currently working on reviewing/aquiring 
                skills that will help me reach my full potential as a software engineer while working at Carleton College.
                Please feel free to explore this page and my github repo. (11/23/2022)
                I will add links here later.
            </p>

                    <h3>Carleton College - Northfield, MN</h3>
                    <p>Bachelor of Arts, <i>Magna Cum Laude</i> 2018-2022</p>
                    <p><i>Phi Betta Kappa</i></p>
                    <p>Major in Computer Science</p>
                    <p>
                        I explored a wide range of subjects outside of Computer Science at Carleton.
                        I have a good understanding of calculus, linear algebra, and mathmatical proofs.
                        In the latter half of my college years, I explored a career in medicine. I have taken 
                        high level courses in the sciences, such as biochemistry and human physiology and learned 
                        important communication skills through pre-med classes, research, and volunteering at hospitals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also have student work experience as a tutor in both Japanese and Computer Science. As a Japanese 
                        tutor, I helped out students of all levels with their homework assignments or understanding grammer or 
                        the culture. As a computer science tutor, I held lab sessions where I would help students mainly with 
                        their python or java assignments and I also graded assignments from classes and provided appropriate 
                        feedback to each student.
