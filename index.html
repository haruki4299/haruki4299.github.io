        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hi! My name is Haruki. I am from Tokyo, Japan and I recently graduated from Carleton college with a
            Computer Science degree. During the latter half of college, I explored medicine as a career path. 
            After my gap year I figured out what I want for my career and here I am playing some catch up.
            My strengths are my ability to learn, aquired throughout my education up to college, my hard working
            nature, which may be related to my perfectionist personality, and I love problem-solving. 
            I've also developed skills to be a great leader/team player through my premed work which turned out to 
            be surprisingly useful when I was back in my CS classes. I am currently working on reviewing/aquiring 
            skills that will help me reach my full potential as a software engineer while working at Carleton College.
            Please feel free to explore this page and my github repo. (11/23/2022)
            I will add links here later.
